# Validation Framework Documentation

## Overview

The Validation Framework is an integral part of the research orchestrator, designed to ensure the quality and integrity of research outputs through systematic validation processes.

## Components

1. **Evidence Validator**: Checks the authenticity and compliance of evidence with citation standards.
2. **Recency Validator**: Ensures that all evidence is up-to-date and relevant.
3. **Quality Validator**: Assesses the overall quality of the research findings.

## Evidence Validator

The Evidence Validator performs the following checks:
- Validates the source and type of evidence.
- Ensures compliance with citation requirements.
- Verifies the credibility of the evidence.

## Recency Validator

The Recency Validator checks:
- The publication date of the evidence.
- The relevance of the evidence to current research topics.

## Quality Validator

The Quality Validator evaluates:
- The coherence and consistency of the research findings.
- The adherence to research standards and methodologies.
