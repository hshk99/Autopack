# Autopack Project Configuration
# Minimal config following GPT's recommendation - only what the system actually uses

project:
  name: "Autopack"
  type: "backend"  # backend|frontend|fullstack|library|cli

quality:
  test_strictness: "normal"  # lenient|normal|strict
  # lenient: No hard coverage requirements, Auditor can be more flexible
  # normal: Prefer tests, warn on coverage drops, standard Auditor rigor
  # strict: Require tests-first, block on coverage regression, strict Auditor

documentation:
  mode: "minimal"  # skip|minimal|full
  # skip: No auto-documentation updates
  # minimal: Update README stats, CHANGELOG for major changes only (current behavior)
  # full: Full documentation generation for all phases

# Note: Global defaults can be added to ~/.autopack/config.yaml later if needed
# For now, all config is per-project
