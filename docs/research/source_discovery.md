# Source Discovery Documentation

## Overview

Source discovery involves identifying and accessing relevant information sources to fulfill research intents. This process is critical for ensuring comprehensive and accurate research outcomes.

## Components

1. **GitHub Discovery**: Searches repositories and issues on GitHub to find relevant code and discussions.
2. **Reddit Discovery**: Mines Reddit threads and comments for community insights and opinions.
3. **Web Discovery**: Utilizes web scraping and search APIs to gather information from various online sources.

## Strategies

- **Keyword Matching**: Uses keywords from the research intent to search across different platforms.
- **Relevance Scoring**: Ranks sources based on their relevance to the query.
- **Source Evaluation**: Assesses the credibility and reliability of sources before inclusion.

## Implementation

Each discovery component is implemented as a separate module, allowing for modular updates and maintenance. They are designed to work in parallel, providing a comprehensive set of data for the research process.

## Usage

The source discovery process is triggered after intent clarification, ensuring that the search is aligned with the refined research goals.
