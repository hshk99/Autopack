# GPT-4o Review Prompt for Autopack Run Analysis

## Review the attached AUTOPACK_RUN_ANALYSIS_FOR_GPT_REVIEW.md and answer these 7 questions:

1. **Did all phases complete successfully?** (1/9 phases COMPLETE, 0 tokens used - what does this mean?)

2. **Token usage efficiency?** (Expected ~135k tokens, Actual 0 tokens - can efficiency be evaluated?)

3. **Is Autopack behaving as expected?** (Expected: Build→Review→Gate→Apply. Actual: Crashed before any work)

4. **Areas of concern?** Rank by severity:
   - Incomplete end-to-end testing (pipeline untested)
   - Zero tokens despite completion claims
   - Phase state management (stuck in EXECUTING)
   - No CI/CD integration

5. **Settings improvements for token efficiency?**
   - Should context engineering be implemented (selective file loading)?
   - Token budget warnings needed?
   - Per-phase token limits?
   - Model selection based on complexity?

6. **CI flow and main branch merge strategy?**
   - When should CI tests run? (per phase? per tier? end of run?)
   - When should auto-merge occur? (never? per phase? end of run?)
   - What conditions for auto-merge? (tests pass? zero issues? human approval?)
   - Branch management strategy?

7. **Troubleshooting efficiency improvements?**
   - Error detection/recovery mechanisms?
   - Debugging tools needed?
   - Observability/monitoring?

## Deliverable Format:
1. Executive Summary (key findings, critical issues, readiness assessment)
2. Detailed answers to all 7 questions
3. Prioritized Action Plan (Immediate/Short-term/Medium-term/Long-term)
4. Token efficiency recommendations with estimated savings
5. CI/CD integration blueprint (flow diagram + merge strategy)
6. Risk assessment  
7. Success criteria for next run

## Reference:
- Analysis file: AUTOPACK_RUN_ANALYSIS_FOR_GPT_REVIEW.md (same directory)
- Run: fileorg-phase2-beta
- Status: INCOMPLETE (0/8 phases autonomously executed, 0 tokens used, Unicode error halted execution)
