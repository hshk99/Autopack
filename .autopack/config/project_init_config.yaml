    # What to tell GPT about Autopack
    context_message: |
      **Autopack Context for GPT:**

      I'm using Autopack, an autonomous build system that will:
      - Execute the implementation autonomously (50 phases)
      - Handle all coding, testing, and integration
      - Track progress and manage the build

      **Your Role (GPT):**
      Focus purely on strategic guidance and analysis:
      - Market analysis and competitive positioning
      - Technology stack recommendations
      - Architecture design decisions
      - Research on best practices/benchmarks
      - Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
      - Success criteria definition

      **You DON'T Need to Worry About:**
      - Implementation details (Autopack handles this)
      - Code examples (not needed at this stage)
      - Step-by-step tutorials (Autopack will figure it out)
      - Project management (Autopack tracks phases)

  ## Context: Autopack Autonomous Build System

  I'm using **Autopack**, an autonomous build system that will handle all implementation.

  **What Autopack Does**:
  - Executes 50 phases autonomously (coding, testing, integration)
  - Uses AI (GPT-4o, Claude Opus/Sonnet) for builder and auditor
  - Tracks progress, manages dependencies
  - Handles git operations, CI/CD

  **Your Role**:
  Focus purely on **strategic guidance and analysis**. Don't worry about implementation—Autopack handles that.

  ## Notes

  - Be specific (e.g., "Use Tauri 2.0" not "consider Tauri")
  - Provide justifications for recommendations
  - Cite benchmarks/data when available
  - Focus on strategic decisions, not implementation details
