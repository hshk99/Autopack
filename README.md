# Autopack

Autopack is an autonomous build framework (Builder → Auditor → Quality Gate) designed to be safe, deterministic, and mechanically enforceable via CI contracts.

## How this repo is meant to be used (especially by LLMs)

This repo is structured so that **LLMs (Cursor / Claude / etc.) should rely on SOT ledgers** as the canonical, machine-consumable “memory”:

- `docs/BUILD_HISTORY.md`: what changed and what was verified
- `docs/DEBUG_LOG.md`: failures → root cause → fix → verification
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`: durable rationale (“why”)

`README.md` intentionally stays short to avoid stale build journals and “two truths”. The navigation hub is `docs/INDEX.md`.

### “One stream” intention flow (plan → build → tidy → memory → reuse)

Autopack is designed so that high-signal information **survives** and becomes reusable:

- **Planning / execution artifacts** (run/tier/phase outcomes, summaries, telemetry) are produced during runs.
- **Tidy consolidates** durable learnings into the SOT ledgers above (append-only).
- **Optional runtime retrieval**: the executor can index/retrieve SOT chunks via `MemoryService` (vector memory: Qdrant/FAISS) when enabled:
  - `AUTOPACK_ENABLE_SOT_MEMORY_INDEXING=true`
  - `AUTOPACK_SOT_RETRIEVAL_ENABLED=true`

Note: SOT→DB sync (`scripts/tidy/sot_db_sync.py`) exists as a derived index (`sot_entries`) for DB/Qdrant sync workflows; **runtime decisioning currently uses vector memory retrieval**, not DB reads from `sot_entries`.

**Full historical README (preserved, no information deleted)**: `docs/README_FULL.md`

## Quickstart

- **Run the API (dev)**:
  - `python -m uvicorn autopack.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8100` (ensure `PYTHONPATH=src`)
- **Run an executor**:
  - `python src/autopack/autonomous_executor.py --run-id my-run`

## Docs (start here)

- **Docs index (navigation hub)**: `docs/INDEX.md`
- **Build ledger (authoritative)**: `docs/BUILD_HISTORY.md`
- **Debug ledger (authoritative)**: `docs/DEBUG_LOG.md`
- **Architecture decisions (authoritative)**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
- **Changelog (historical ledger)**: `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
- **Reliability track (P0 + P1)**: `docs/P0_RELIABILITY_DECISIONS.md`
