  Unified Research Plan gap: add concrete example sessions and align docs paths.

  The unified plan references example markdown artifacts under an `examples/` directory.
  Existing research chunks created documentation under `docs/research/`, but examples
  are not consistently present as standalone runnable narratives.

goals:
  - Add 3 detailed example session documents (market/app/autopack)
  - Ensure docs are internally linked and not stale

deliverables:
  docs:
    - examples/market_research_example.md
    - examples/app_research_example.md
    - examples/autopack_research_example.md
    - docs/research/EXAMPLES.md

features:
  - Each example includes:
    - goal, inputs, configuration, expected outputs
    - a short “what can go wrong” section and troubleshooting pointers
    - references to CLI commands and API endpoints (if available)

validation:
  quality:
    - No broken relative links in the example docs
    - Examples reference current commands/paths
