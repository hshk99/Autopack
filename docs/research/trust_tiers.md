# Trust Tiers Documentation

## Overview

Trust tiers categorize information sources based on their reliability and credibility. This system helps prioritize data from more trustworthy sources during the research process.

## Trust Levels

1. **High Trust**: Sources with a strong reputation and verified accuracy, such as peer-reviewed journals and official publications.
2. **Medium Trust**: Generally reliable sources, including reputable news sites and well-known blogs.
3. **Low Trust**: Sources with potential biases or unverified claims, such as personal blogs and forums.

## Implementation

Trust tiers are assigned based on a combination of automated assessments and manual reviews. Factors considered include the source's history, author credentials, and cross-references with other trusted sources.

## Usage

Trust tiers are used to filter and rank information during the source discovery process. Higher trust sources are prioritized, ensuring that the research is based on credible data.

## Maintenance

The trust tier system is regularly updated to reflect changes in source reliability and to incorporate new sources as they become available.
