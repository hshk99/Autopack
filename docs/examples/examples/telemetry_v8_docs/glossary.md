# Glossary

Key terms and concepts used throughout the AutoPack project.

## Core Concepts

### Phase
A discrete unit of work in the autonomous build process, representing a specific task or operation to be executed.

### Tier
A classification level that groups phases by complexity, priority, or execution order within the build pipeline.

### Run
A complete execution cycle of the autonomous build system, encompassing multiple phases from start to finish.

### Builder
The component responsible for executing build operations, processing source files, and generating output artifacts.

### Auditor
A system component that monitors, validates, and reports on build processes to ensure correctness and compliance.

## Configuration

### Configuration File
A YAML file (typically `autopack.yaml`) that defines project settings, build parameters, and file inclusion/exclusion patterns.

### Cache Directory
A local storage location (default: `~/.autopack/cache`) where AutoPack stores temporary data and build artifacts for performance optimization.

## Build Process

### Build Artifact
An output file or package generated by the build process, stored in the configured output directory.

### Telemetry
Data collection and monitoring system that tracks build performance, resource usage, and system behavior for analysis and optimization.

### Autonomous Build
An automated build process that requires minimal human intervention, using intelligent configuration and self-optimization capabilities.
