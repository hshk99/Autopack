      "description": "Executor enters infinite loop when execute_phase() returns before exhausting max_attempts (due to Doctor/health checks). Phase remains QUEUED in database, main loop re-picks it, causing infinite retry cycle.",
      "root_cause": "State management split between instance attributes (attempt_index) and database (phase.state). When execute_phase() returns early, database not updated to FAILED, causing re-selection.",
      "impact": "Blocks long autonomous runs, wastes token budget on infinite retries",
