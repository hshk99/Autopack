# Research Orchestrator Documentation

## Overview

The Research Orchestrator is designed to manage a comprehensive 5-stage research pipeline, ensuring that each stage is executed with precision and adherence to quality standards.

## Pipeline Stages

1. **Research Intent Definition**: Establishes the goals and objectives of the research.
2. **Evidence Collection**: Gathers relevant data and sources to support the research intent.
3. **Analysis and Synthesis**: Analyzes the collected evidence and synthesizes findings.
4. **Validation and Review**: Validates the findings against predefined quality metrics.
5. **Publication and Reporting**: Prepares the final report and disseminates the findings.

## Orchestrator Components

- **Session Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of a research session.
- **Evidence Model**: Ensures all evidence meets citation and quality standards.
- **Validation Framework**: Provides tools to validate each stage of the research process.

## Session Manager

The Session Manager is responsible for:
- Initiating and terminating research sessions.
- Tracking progress across all pipeline stages.
- Handling session-specific configurations and data.

## Quality Assurance

The orchestrator integrates a robust validation framework that:
- Enforces evidence quality and recency.
- Ensures compliance with research standards.
- Provides detailed reports on validation outcomes.

## Conclusion

The Research Orchestrator is a vital tool for conducting structured and reliable research, ensuring that all outputs are backed by high-quality evidence and rigorous validation.
