---

## CRITICAL: This Analysis Has Changed

### What's Different (V2):
1. **Rigorous business framework applied** (TAM/SAM/SOM, switching costs, unit economics)
2. **GO/NO-GO score: 6.6/10 (CONDITIONAL GO ⚠️)** - Not a slam dunk
3. **Strategic pivot**: Start with General users (freemium), not Legal-only niche
4. **Weak competitive moat identified**: 12-24 month lead before competitors catch up
5. **Capital requirement**: $400K+ with 18-24 month payback

### Your Critical Mission:
**Validate or challenge the GO/NO-GO decision and scoring.** If you disagree with the 6.6/10 score or CONDITIONAL GO recommendation, explain why with data.

**Segment Priority Matrix** (in research):
| Segment | Market Size | LTV/CAC | Priority |
|---------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Legal Professionals | 5M × $50-$150/mo | 6.0 | **1st (Highest ARPU)** |
| General Users | 200M × $5-$15/mo | 3.0 | **2nd (Largest pool)** |
| Small Businesses | 10M × $10-$30/mo | 4.8 | **3rd (Phase 2)** |

**REVISED STRATEGY**: Start with General Users (freemium for mass market), upsell Legal features (premium tier for high ARPU)

#### Part 3: Competitive Landscape
- 27+ solutions analyzed (privacy-first, enterprise legal, commercial organizers)
- Competitor revenue/users quantified where available
- User complaints documented (Sparkle: Mac-only, ChronoVault: expensive)

#### Part 4: Switching Cost Analysis (MOST CRITICAL)
**From Sparkle (Mac General Users)**:
- Weaknesses: Mac-only, limited control, imprecise categorization, one-time cleanup
- Switching Barrier: LOW-MEDIUM (<$100 cost, <1 hour time)
- What We Must Offer: Cross-platform, content understanding (OCR+LLM), granular control
- **Realistic Switching Likelihood: 40-50%** (NOT guaranteed!)

**From ChronoVault/Casefleet (Legal Professionals)**:
- Weaknesses: Expensive ($100-$500/mo), cloud-only, enterprise-focused, steep learning curve
- Switching Barrier: HIGH ($3K-$10K sunk cost, 10-40 hours migration time)
- What We Must Offer: Affordable ($50-$100/mo), local-first, solo practitioner focus, simple UI
- **Realistic Switching Likelihood: 30-40%** (mission-critical tools hard to switch)

#### Part 5: True Differentiation Analysis
- ❌ WEAK: "We're cross-platform", "We're privacy-first", "We're cheaper" (10% better, not 10x)
- ✅ STRONG: "First AI file organizer that understands document CONTENT (not just filenames), works cross-platform, includes professional legal timeline features at 1/5th the price of enterprise tools - all while keeping your data private and offline."

**Question for GPT**: Is this 10x better, or just 2-3x better? Be brutally honest.

#### Part 6: Pricing Strategy & Revenue Model
**Proposed Multi-Tier Strategy**:
- **Free Tier**: 1,000 files/month, basic AI organization, local OCR only → Mass market capture
- **Pro Tier** ($9.99/mo): Unlimited files, cloud OCR, advanced features → General power users
- **Business Tier** ($49.99/mo): Legal timeline, evidence org, case summaries, priority support → Legal professionals
- **Enterprise Tier** (Custom): Team features, API access, SSO, SLA → Big clients (Phase 2+)

**Revenue Projections**:
| Year | Total Users | Paid Users | Conversion | Revenue |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|---------|
| 1 | 10,000 | 500 | 5% | $108K |
| 3 | 100,000 | 8,000 | 8% | $1.92M |
| 5 | 500,000 | 50,000 | 10% | $12M |

**Assumptions**: 50% Free tier, 40% Pro tier ($10/mo avg), 10% Business tier ($50/mo avg)

#### Part 7: Profitability Analysis
**Unit Economics** (weighted average across all segments):
- **CAC**: $80 (content marketing $30-$50, legal marketing $200-$400, weighted)
- **LTV**: $510 (General $80-$150, Legal $1,200-$3,600, Business $600-$1,800, weighted)
- **LTV/CAC Ratio**: 6.4 (✅ EXCELLENT - target >3.0)
- **Payback Period**: 5 months (✅ GOOD - target <12 months)
- **Break-even**: 18-24 months (5,000-8,000 paying users)
- **Year 3 Profit**: $1.22M (on $1.92M revenue, 63% margin)

**Capital Requirement**: $400K-$600K (development $200K-$300K, marketing $150K-$250K, infrastructure $50K-$100K)

#### Part 8: Technical Feasibility & Risk
**Technology Stack Validated**:
- Desktop Framework: Tauri 2.0 (3-10MB binaries, 30-40MB RAM, <0.5s startup)
- OCR Strategy: Hybrid (Tesseract primary 30% accuracy, GPT-4 Vision fallback 80% accuracy)
- Local LLM: Qwen2-7B (3.85/5 legal eval, 16GB RAM, broader capabilities than SaulLM-7B)
- Database: SQLite (sufficient for 10k-100k files)

**Limitations Identified**:
- 16GB RAM requirement excludes ~40% of consumer PCs
- Tauri WebView inconsistencies (CSS rendering, JavaScript API differences)
- Local LLM inference quality uncertain for complex legal context
- OCR accuracy gap (Tesseract 30% vs GPT-4 Vision 80%)

#### Part 9: GO/NO-GO Recommendation

### Scores (Out of 10):
- **Market Opportunity**: 7.5/10 (GOOD)
  - ✅ Large, growing market ($13.7B, 17.9% CAGR)
  - ✅ Multiple customer segments (General, Legal, Business)
  - ✅ Clear pain points (Sparkle: Mac-only, Legal tools: expensive)
  - ⚠️ Moderate growth rate (17.9% not explosive)

- **Competitive Position**: 5.5/10 (WEAK ⚠️)
  - ✅ 40-50% switching likelihood from Sparkle (reasonable)
  - ⚠️ Differentiation unclear (is cross-platform + legal 10x better?)
  - ❌ Weak moat (12-24 month lead, easily replicable by Sparkle/competitors)
  - ❌ High competition (27+ existing solutions)

- **Financial Viability**: 6.5/10 (MODERATE)
  - ✅ Strong unit economics (LTV/CAC = 6.4)
  - ✅ Short payback period (5 months)
  - ⚠️ High capital requirement ($400K+)
  - ⚠️ Long break-even (18-24 months)

- **Technical Feasibility**: 7/10 (GOOD)
  - ✅ Proven tech stack (Tauri, Tesseract, Qwen2-7B)
  - ✅ 16GB RAM manageable for target users
  - ⚠️ Tauri WebView risks (UI inconsistencies)
  - ⚠️ Local LLM inference quality uncertain

### **Overall Score: 6.6/10 (CONDITIONAL GO ⚠️)**

### Recommendation: **CONDITIONAL GO** with significant caveats

**Why GO**:
1. Large, growing market ($13.7B, 17.9% CAGR) with clear pain points
2. Strong unit economics (LTV/CAC = 6.4, payback 5 months)
3. Multiple revenue streams (freemium general users + premium legal users)
4. Moderate switching likelihood (40-50% from Sparkle, 30-40% from Legal tools)
5. Proven technology stack (Tauri, Tesseract, Qwen2-7B benchmarked)

**Why CAUTIOUS (Red Flags)**:
1. **Weak competitive moat** (12-24 month lead, easily replicable)
   - Sparkle could add cross-platform support
   - Open-source competitors could add legal features
   - ChronoVault could lower prices
   - **Question**: What prevents copycats?

2. **Differentiation unclear** (is cross-platform + legal 10x better, or just 2-3x?)
   - "Cross-platform" is not 10x (it's table stakes)
   - "Privacy-first" is niche (many prefer cloud convenience)
   - "Legal features" are replicable
   - **Question**: What's our TRULY defensible advantage?

3. **High capital requirement** ($400K+) with 18-24 month payback
   - Requires significant upfront investment
   - Long time to break-even
   - **Question**: Do we have funding or bootstrapping?

4. **Execution risk** (12-18 month window before competitors catch up)
   - Must ship MVP in 6-9 months
   - Must acquire 5,000 users in 18-24 months
   - **Question**: Can Autopack execute this fast?

### If GO: Strategic Imperatives (TOP 3)

**IMPERATIVE 1: NAIL THE 10X DIFFERENTIATION** (Months 1-6)
- Problem: Current differentiation is weak (cross-platform + legal is 2-3x better, not 10x)
- Action: Make content understanding 10x better than Sparkle's filename-based categorization
  - Sparkle: "Document1.pdf" → "Documents" (imprecise)
  - Us: "Document1.pdf" (contains text "evidence of employer misconduct") → "Evidence/Employer Misconduct/2024-11-27" (precise)
- Metric: 90%+ categorization accuracy vs Sparkle's 60-70%
- **Question for GPT**: Is this truly 10x better? What else would make it 10x?

**IMPERATIVE 2: VALIDATE SEGMENT PRIORITIZATION EARLY** (Month 6 Decision)
- Problem: Conflicting signals on General vs Legal focus
  - General: Larger market (200M vs 5M), lower CAC ($30-$50 vs $200-$400), but marginal LTV/CAC (1.6-3.0)
  - Legal: Higher ARPU ($50-$150/mo vs $5-$15/mo), excellent LTV/CAC (3.0-9.0), but higher switching barrier
- Action: Launch freemium for General users (Months 1-6), measure conversion rates
- Decision Point (Month 6): If General user conversion <5%, pivot to Legal-only (higher ARPU justifies higher CAC)
- **Question for GPT**: Which segment should we bet on? General (mass market) or Legal (high ARPU)?

**IMPERATIVE 3: EXECUTE FAST (12-18 Month Window)** (Months 1-18)
- Problem: Weak competitive moat means 12-24 month lead before Sparkle/competitors catch up
- Action: Ship MVP in 6-9 months, iterate rapidly based on user feedback
- Milestones:
  - Month 6: MVP launch (basic AI organization + legal timeline)
  - Month 12: 1,000 users, 50 paying ($5K MRR)
  - Month 18: 5,000 users, 250 paying ($25K MRR)
- **Question for GPT**: Is 50-phase build realistic in 6-9 months? Should we scope down MVP?

### If NO-GO: Dealbreakers

If you recommend NO-GO (disagree with 6.6/10), what are the dealbreakers?
1. Competitive moat too weak (easily replicable)?
2. Differentiation insufficient (not 10x better)?
3. Capital requirement too high ($400K+ vs expected returns)?
4. Execution risk too high (12-18 month window too aggressive)?
5. Segment confusion (unclear whether to target General or Legal)?

**Question for GPT**: Do any of these rise to the level of "don't build"?

## Strategic Questions for Your Analysis

### PART 1: GO/NO-GO VALIDATION (MOST CRITICAL)

**Question 1: Do you agree with the 6.6/10 score and CONDITIONAL GO recommendation?**
- If YES: What are the top 3 risks to mitigate?
- If NO: What score would you give (1-10) and why? What are the dealbreakers?

**Question 2: Is the differentiation truly 10x better, or just 2-3x?**
- Current claim: "Content understanding (OCR+LLM) vs filename-based categorization"
- Sparkle weakness: Mac-only, imprecise categorization, one-time cleanup
- Our advantage: Cross-platform, precise categorization, continuous monitoring
- **Brutally honest assessment**: Is this 10x better, or just "a little bit different"?

**Question 3: Can we defend against copycats?**
- Sparkle could add Windows/Linux support (cross-platform)
- Open-source competitors could add legal features
- ChronoVault could lower prices
- **What's our TRULY defensible moat?** (Technology barrier? Data advantage? Network effects? Brand/trust?)

**Question 4: Which customer segment should we prioritize?**
- **Option A: General Users First (Freemium)**
  - Pros: Largest market (200M), lowest CAC ($30-$50), mass adoption
  - Cons: Marginal LTV/CAC (1.6-3.0), low ARPU ($5-$15/mo), high churn risk
  - Strategy: Acquire 100K free users, convert 5-10% to paid ($500K-$1M revenue)

- **Option B: Legal Professionals First (Premium)**
  - Pros: Excellent LTV/CAC (3.0-9.0), high ARPU ($50-$150/mo), low churn
  - Cons: Small market (5M), high CAC ($200-$400), high switching barrier
  - Strategy: Acquire 5K legal users, convert 30-40% to paid ($300K-$600K revenue)

- **Option C: Hybrid (Recommended in Research)**
  - Strategy: Launch freemium for General (mass market), upsell Legal features (premium tier)
  - Month 6 Decision Point: If General conversion <5%, pivot to Legal-only
  - **Question**: Is this the right approach? Or should we pick one segment and nail it?

**Question 5: Is 50-phase build realistic given 12-18 month urgency?**
- Competitive window: 12-24 months before Sparkle/competitors catch up
- MVP target: 6-9 months (to start user acquisition)
- 50 phases in 6-9 months = 5-7 phases/month
- **Question**: Should we scope down MVP to 30-40 phases? What features defer to Phase 2?

---

### PART 2: MARKET STRATEGY (IF GO)

**Question 6: Pricing Strategy Validation**
- Proposed:
  - Free: 1,000 files/month, local OCR only
  - Pro: $9.99/mo, unlimited files, cloud OCR
  - Business: $49.99/mo, legal timeline, case summaries
  - Enterprise: Custom (Phase 2+)
- **Questions**:
  - Is free tier too generous (1,000 files/month)? Should it be 100-500?
  - Is Pro tier ($9.99) too cheap? (Sparkle is ~$20-$30)
  - Is Business tier ($49.99) competitive? (ChronoVault is $100-$500/mo)
  - Should we offer annual discount (20% off) to improve LTV?

**Question 7: Go-to-Market Strategy**
- Research suggests: Start with content marketing (CAC $30-$50 for General, $200-$400 for Legal)
- Channels: SEO, blog posts, YouTube tutorials, Reddit/HN communities
- **Questions**:
  - Which marketing channel first? (SEO for long-term, Reddit for quick wins?)
  - Should we target legal professionals on LinkedIn? (higher CAC but better LTV)
  - Should we partner with legal aid organizations? (credibility + case studies)

**Question 8: Competitive Positioning Statement**
- Research suggests: "First AI file organizer that understands document CONTENT (not just filenames), works cross-platform, includes professional legal timeline features at 1/5th the price of enterprise tools - all while keeping your data private and offline."
- **Questions**:
  - Is this compelling? (Does it make Sparkle users switch?)
  - Is "1/5th the price" a weak selling point? (Race to bottom)
  - Should we emphasize privacy more? (Or is that niche?)

---

### PART 3: PRODUCT STRATEGY (IF GO)

**Question 9: MVP Definition (Phase 1 vs Deferred)**
- Must-Have (MVP - Phase 1):
  - Multi-pass analysis (Discovery → Analysis → Review → Execution → Validation)
  - OCR (Tesseract primary, GPT-4 Vision fallback)
  - Context understanding (Qwen2-7B local LLM)
  - Renaming (AI-powered, user-editable)
  - Folder structure (legal timeline: Evidence/Employer Misconduct/2024-11-27)
  - Index generation (case summary Markdown file)
  - Rollback capability (operations log)
  - Wizard UI (elderly-friendly, 7 steps)

- Should-Have (Phase 2 - Defer if Needed):
  - Duplicate detection (content hash + semantic embeddings)
  - Bulk preview (show all operations before execution)
  - Confidence scores (yellow = medium confidence)
  - Cross-reference validation (detect internal document references)

- Nice-to-Have (Phase 3+):
  - Semantic search (vector embeddings)
  - Continuous monitoring (watch folder, auto-organize)
  - Cloud storage integration (Dropbox, Google Drive)

- **Question**: Is this MVP scope realistic for 6-9 months? What should we defer?

**Question 10: Technology Stack (Profit-Aware)**
- Desktop Framework: Tauri 2.0 (3-10MB binaries, 30-40MB RAM)
  - **Question**: Tauri WebView inconsistencies acceptable? Or use Electron for UI consistency?
  - **Trade-off**: Lightweight (Tauri) vs Consistent UI (Electron)

- OCR Strategy: Hybrid (Tesseract primary, GPT-4 Vision fallback)
  - **Question**: Is hybrid approach optimal? Cost for 1,000 pages = $10-$30 (GPT-4 Vision)
  - **Trade-off**: Privacy (Tesseract-only) vs Accuracy (GPT-4 Vision)

- Local LLM: Qwen2-7B (3.85/5 legal eval, 16GB RAM, broader capabilities)
  - **Question**: Is Qwen2-7B sufficient for legal context inference? Or need SaulLM-7B (legal-specific)?
  - **Trade-off**: General capability (Qwen2) vs Legal expertise (SaulLM)

- Database: SQLite (sufficient for 10k-100k files)
  - **Question**: SQLite vs DuckDB (analytical queries)? Or overkill?

**Question 11: Architecture Design**
- Proposed: Scanner → OCR → Analyzer (LLM) → Categorizer → Renamer → Organizer → Validator → UI
- Human checkpoints: After Discovery (confirm files), After Analysis (review categories), After Renaming (preview), After Execution (rollback)
- **Questions**:
  - Is this sound?
  - What if user cancels mid-execution? (partial operations)
  - What operations are NOT reversible? (original file deleted)

---

### PART 4: FINANCIAL VIABILITY (CRITICAL)

**Question 12: Unit Economics Deep Dive**
- Research calculated: LTV/CAC = 6.4 (weighted average)
- **Questions**:
  - Is 6.4 LTV/CAC achievable? (assumes 20 month retention, 70% margin)
  - What if churn is higher? (12 month retention → LTV/CAC = 3.8)
  - What if CAC is higher? ($150 CAC → LTV/CAC = 3.4)
  - What's the sensitivity? (CAC +$50 or LTV -$100 = what impact?)

**Question 13: Revenue Projections Validation**
- Year 1: 10,000 users, 500 paid (5% conversion), $108K revenue
- Year 3: 100,000 users, 8,000 paid (8% conversion), $1.92M revenue
- Year 5: 500,000 users, 50,000 paid (10% conversion), $12M revenue
- **Questions**:
  - Are these conversion rates realistic? (5% → 8% → 10%)
  - Are these user growth rates achievable? (10K → 100K → 500K)
  - What's the CAC payback at each stage? (Year 1 CAC $80 × 500 = $40K, revenue $108K = 4 months payback)

**Question 14: Break-Even Analysis**
- Research calculated: 18-24 months to break-even (5,000-8,000 paying users)
- Assumptions: $400K-$600K capital requirement, 70% margin
- **Questions**:
  - Is 18-24 month break-even acceptable? (vs typical SaaS 12-18 months)
  - What if capital requirement is higher? ($800K → 30-36 month break-even)
  - What if margin is lower? (50% margin → 24-30 month break-even)

**Question 15: Funding Strategy**
- Capital requirement: $400K-$600K (development $200K-$300K, marketing $150K-$250K, infrastructure $50K-$100K)
- **Questions**:
  - Bootstrap (self-funded) or raise seed round?
  - If seed round: How much to raise? ($500K? $1M?)
  - If bootstrap: Can we scope down MVP to $200K-$300K?

---

### PART 5: RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

**Question 16: Competitive Moat Strengthening**
- Problem: 12-24 month lead before Sparkle/competitors catch up (WEAK moat)
- **Questions**:
  - How to extend competitive lead? (patents? proprietary data? network effects?)
  - Should we open-source core (build community moat) or keep proprietary (technology moat)?
  - Can we build data advantage? (user-trained models improve over time)
  - Can we build brand/trust? (legal professionals trust "certified" tools)

**Question 17: Top 10 Risks (Likelihood × Impact)**
From research, identify top risks:
1. **Competitive moat too weak** (Sparkle adds cross-platform, game over)
2. **Differentiation insufficient** (users don't see 10x value, don't switch)
3. **Segment confusion** (target General or Legal? Can't serve both well)
4. **Capital requirement underestimated** ($600K → $1M actual)
5. **Local LLM insufficient** (Qwen2-7B can't infer legal context, need cloud LLM)
6. **Tauri WebView inconsistencies** (UI broken on Linux, users frustrated)
7. **OCR accuracy too low** (Tesseract 30% not good enough, users churn)
8. **16GB RAM requirement** (excludes 40% of users, market too small)
9. **Legal liability** (AI miscategorizes evidence, user loses case, lawsuit)
10. **Market timing wrong** (enterprise tools lower prices, our advantage gone)

**Question**: For each risk, what's the likelihood (1-10) and impact (1-10)? What's the mitigation?

**Question 18: Mitigation Strategies**
For top 5 risks above:
- **Risk 1 (Competitive moat)**: Mitigation = Execute fast (12-18 months), build brand/trust, open-source core?
- **Risk 2 (Differentiation)**: Mitigation = Nail content understanding 10x better, measure 90%+ accuracy?
- **Risk 3 (Segment confusion)**: Mitigation = Month 6 decision point (General <5% conversion → pivot Legal)?
- **Risk 4 (Capital)**: Mitigation = Scope down MVP (30-40 phases), bootstrap to $300K?
- **Risk 5 (Local LLM)**: Mitigation = Hybrid approach (local primary, cloud fallback), measure accuracy?

**Question 19: Contingency Plans**
- If Sparkle adds cross-platform in Month 12 → What do we do? (pivot to Legal-only? double down on accuracy?)
- If General user conversion <5% at Month 6 → Pivot to Legal-only? (already planned)
- If funding runs out at Month 15 → Scope down features? Raise bridge round? Shut down?

---

### PART 6: BUILD PLAN VALIDATION

**Question 20: Is 50 Phases Realistic?**
- Competitive urgency: 12-18 month window before copycats
- MVP target: 6-9 months
- 50 phases in 6-9 months = 5-7 phases/month (aggressive!)
- **Questions**:
  - Is 5-7 phases/month achievable with Autopack? (autonomous build system)
  - Should we scope down to 30-40 phases for MVP?
  - What features defer to Phase 2? (duplicate detection, cross-reference validation, semantic search)

**Question 21: Tier Structure**
- Proposed: 5-6 tiers
  - Tier 1: Core Infrastructure (5-10 phases)
  - Tier 2: AI Processing (OCR, LLM integration) (10-15 phases)
  - Tier 3: Organization Logic (categorization, renaming, folder structure) (10-15 phases)
  - Tier 4: UI/UX (wizard, preview, rollback) (10-15 phases)
  - Tier 5: Index/Summary (legal timeline, case summary) (5-10 phases)
  - Tier 6: Testing/Polish (cross-platform testing, elderly usability) (5-10 phases)
- **Questions**:
  - Is this tier structure sound?
  - What's the critical path? (longest dependency chain)
  - Can any tiers run in parallel? (UI + AI Processing?)

**Question 22: MVP vs Phase 2 Split**
Based on 12-18 month urgency:
- **MVP (Months 1-9)**: Must-have features only (30-40 phases)
  - Multi-pass analysis, OCR, LLM, renaming, folder structure, rollback, wizard UI
- **Phase 2 (Months 10-18)**: Should-have features (10-20 phases)
  - Duplicate detection, bulk preview, confidence scores, cross-reference validation
- **Phase 3 (Months 19+)**: Nice-to-have features (deferred)
  - Semantic search, continuous monitoring, cloud storage integration
- **Question**: Is this split realistic? What moves from MVP to Phase 2?

After analyzing the attached rigorous research (MARKET_RESEARCH_RIGOROUS_V2.md), please provide:

### **CRITICAL DELIVERABLES**:

#### 1. GO/NO-GO VALIDATION (Score 1-10, Justify)
- Do you agree with 6.6/10 score and CONDITIONAL GO recommendation?
- If YES: What are top 3 risks to mitigate?
- If NO: What score would you give? What are dealbreakers?
- **Be brutally honest**: Is this worth building or not?

#### 2. Strategic Imperatives Validation (IF GO)
- Do you agree with top 3 strategic imperatives?
  - IMPERATIVE 1: Nail 10x differentiation (content understanding 10x better)
  - IMPERATIVE 2: Validate segment prioritization early (Month 6 decision: General vs Legal)
  - IMPERATIVE 3: Execute fast (12-18 month window)
- If NO: What should the top 3 be instead?

#### 3. Segment Prioritization (IF GO)
- Which segment first? General (freemium mass market) or Legal (premium high ARPU)?
- Should we do hybrid (freemium General, upsell Legal) or pick one and nail it?
- Month 6 decision point: If General conversion <5%, pivot to Legal-only?

#### 4. 10x Differentiation Statement (IF GO)
- Is "content understanding vs filename-based categorization" truly 10x better?
- If NOT: What would make it 10x better? (patents? proprietary data? brand/trust?)
- Rewrite differentiation statement to be TRULY compelling

#### 5. Multi-Tier Pricing Recommendation (IF GO)
- Validate or revise: Free ($0), Pro ($9.99/mo), Business ($49.99/mo), Enterprise (Custom)
- Should we offer annual discount (20% off)?
- Should we adjust pricing? (Free too generous? Pro too cheap? Business competitive?)

#### 6. MVP Scope for Phase 1 (IF GO)
- Is 50 phases realistic in 6-9 months? Or scope down to 30-40 phases?
- What features MUST be in MVP? What defers to Phase 2?
- Which features cut if we need to ship in 6 months (not 9)?

#### 7. Dealbreakers (IF NO-GO)
- What would need to change for this to be a GO?
- Is competitive moat the dealbreaker? Differentiation? Capital requirement? Segment confusion?
- Can any of these be fixed? Or fundamental flaws?

### **IMPORTANT DELIVERABLES**:

#### 8. Revenue Projections Validation (IF GO)
- Year 1: $108K realistic? (10K users, 5% conversion)
- Year 3: $1.92M realistic? (100K users, 8% conversion)
- Year 5: $12M realistic? (500K users, 10% conversion)
- What assumptions are most fragile? (conversion rate? churn? CAC?)

#### 9. Unit Economics Validation (IF GO)
- Is LTV/CAC = 6.4 achievable? (assumes 20 month retention, 70% margin, $80 CAC)
- Sensitivity analysis: CAC +$50 or LTV -$100 = what impact?
- What if churn is higher? (12 month retention instead of 20)

#### 10. Technology Stack (Profit-Aware) (IF GO)
- Tauri 2.0 or Electron? (lightweight vs UI consistency trade-off)
- Tesseract-only, GPT-4-only, or Hybrid OCR? (privacy vs accuracy vs cost)
- Qwen2-7B or SaulLM-7B local LLM? (general capability vs legal expertise)
- SQLite or DuckDB? (simple vs analytical)

#### 11. Risk Matrix (Top 10 Risks with Likelihood × Impact) (IF GO)
- Score each risk: Likelihood (1-10) × Impact (1-10) = Priority score
- Top 5 risks with mitigation strategies
- Contingency plans for each (if mitigation fails)

#### 12. Build Plan Validation (IF GO)
- Is 50 phases realistic in 6-9 months? (5-7 phases/month)
- Suggested tier structure (5-6 tiers with phase breakdown)
- Critical path analysis (longest dependency chain)
- MVP vs Phase 2 split (what defers?)

---

### **SUPPORTING DELIVERABLES**:

#### 13. Architecture Design (IF GO)
- Component diagram (text description fine: Scanner → OCR → Analyzer → Categorizer → Renamer → Organizer → Validator → UI)
- Module breakdown with responsibilities
- Data models (files table, operations_log, cross_references)
- Critical workflows (user initiates → final result, error handling, rollback)

#### 14. Success Metrics by Timeframe (IF GO)
- Month 3: ? (MVP alpha testing with 50 users?)
- Month 6: ? (MVP launch, 1K users, 50 paying, $5K MRR)
- Month 12: ? (5K users, 250 paying, $25K MRR)
- Month 18: ? (10K users, 800 paying, $80K MRR)
- Month 24: ? (Break-even, 5K-8K paying)

#### 15. Pivot Triggers (IF GO)
- When to pivot from General to Legal? (General conversion <5% at Month 6)
- When to pivot from local to cloud LLM? (accuracy <80%)
- When to pivot from Tauri to Electron? (UI inconsistencies too severe)
- When to shut down? (funding runs out, competitive moat gone)

## Notes for GPT

- **Be brutally honest**: If you think this is a bad idea (NO-GO), say so and explain why
- **Challenge the 6.6/10 score**: If you disagree, provide your own score with justification
- **Focus on business viability**: Not just "can we build it" but "should we build it"
- **Cite data**: Use numbers from research file (TAM, LTV/CAC, switching likelihood, etc.)
- **Address CONDITIONAL GO caveats**: Weak moat, unclear differentiation, high capital, execution urgency
- **Segment prioritization is CRITICAL**: General vs Legal? Hybrid? This decision affects everything
- **10x differentiation is KEY**: If we're not 10x better, we won't get users to switch
- **Be specific**: "Use Tauri 2.0" not "consider Tauri"
- **Provide justifications**: Back up recommendations with data from research file or your own knowledge
