# Phase 2: Wave Planning

## CRITICAL: TARGET DIRECTORY CHECK

**THIS RULE MUST BE RUN FROM C:\dev\Autopack** (NOT streamdeck_auto_build!)

Before proceeding, verify your current working directory:
1. Check that you are in `C:\dev\Autopack`
2. If you are in `C:\dev\streamdeck_auto_build` - STOP and ask user to open Cursor from Autopack

**Target Repository**: C:\dev\Autopack
**Purpose**: Plan waves for AUTOPACK improvements (NOT streamdeck)

---

Run phase_2.md in C:\Users\hshk9\OneDrive\Backup\Desktop: analyze file conflicts in the newly created AUTOPACK_IMPS_MASTER.json and group IMPs into sequential waves.

**ACTION**: CREATE a new AUTOPACK_WAVE_PLAN.json file at C:\Users\hshk9\OneDrive\Backup\Desktop\AUTOPACK_WAVE_PLAN.json

**COMPLETION MARKER** (REQUIRED):
After wave planning is complete, add this field to the root of AUTOPACK_WAVE_PLAN.json:
```json
"phase2_complete": "<today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format>"
```
