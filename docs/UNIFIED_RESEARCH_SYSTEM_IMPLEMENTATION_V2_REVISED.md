# Unified Research & Marketing System - Implementation Plan v2.2 (AUTOPACK-READY)

This is the **tracked** copy of the unified research implementation plan.

Note: an additional copy also exists under:
- `.autonomous_runs/file-organizer-app-v1/archive/research/active/UNIFIED_RESEARCH_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_V2_REVISED.md`

The tracked copy is preferred for long-lived references because `.autonomous_runs/` is often treated as run artifact storage.

## Diagnostics Parity with Cursor (Important overlap)

Before (or in parallel with) executing any large research phases, implement Diagnostics Parity features so failures create high-signal handoff artifacts:

- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_DIAGNOSTICS_PARITY_WITH_CURSOR.md`
- Follow-up requirement phases (tracked): `requirements/research_followup/`

These features overlap with and strengthen the human review gates in the unified research plan via:
- deterministic handoff bundles (`handoff/index.json`, `handoff/summary.md`, bounded excerpts)
- Cursor-ready prompt generation (`handoff/cursor_prompt.md`)
- optional bounded second-opinion triage (advisory only)
