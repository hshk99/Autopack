# Documentation Link Checker - Ignore Patterns
#
# This configuration defines patterns for links that should be ignored
# or classified differently during documentation link validation.
#
# Categories:
# - runtime_endpoints: API endpoints, localhost URLs that exist at runtime
# - historical_refs: References to archived/superseded content (informational only)
# - external_deps: External URLs that may be temporarily unavailable
# - pattern_ignores: Glob patterns to completely skip
