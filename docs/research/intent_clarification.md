# Intent Clarification Documentation

## Overview

The intent clarification agent is designed to interpret and refine user queries to ensure accurate and relevant research outcomes. It acts as an intermediary, transforming vague or ambiguous requests into precise research intents.

## Functionality

1. **Query Analysis**: Breaks down user queries to identify key components and potential ambiguities.
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Utilizes context from previous interactions to refine the current query.
3. **Clarification Prompts**: Engages users with follow-up questions to resolve ambiguities.
4. **Intent Mapping**: Maps clarified queries to specific research tasks or categories.

## Implementation Details

The agent uses natural language processing techniques to parse and understand user queries. It leverages a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches to enhance its understanding over time.

## Usage

The intent clarification agent is integrated into the research pipeline and is invoked automatically when a new user query is received.
