+# BUILD-132: Coverage Delta Integration - Implementation Status
+
+**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
+**Completion Date**: 2025-12-23
+**Total Phases**: 4/4 Complete
+
+---
+
+## Overview
+
+BUILD-132 successfully replaced the hardcoded `0.0` coverage delta in the Quality Gate with real pytest-cov tracking. The system can now detect coverage regressions by comparing current test coverage against a T0 baseline.
+
+---
+
+## Implementation Summary
+
+### Phase 1: pytest.ini Configuration ✅
+
+**File**: `pytest.ini`
+
+**Changes**:
+- Added `--cov=src/autopack` to track coverage for autopack module
+- Added `--cov-report=json:.coverage.json` to generate machine-readable output
+- Added `--cov-branch` for branch coverage tracking
+
+**Result**: Every pytest run now generates `.coverage.json` with coverage data.
+
+---
+
+### Phase 2: Coverage Tracker Implementation ✅
+
+**File**: `src/autopack/coverage_tracker.py`
+
+**Features**:
+- `calculate_coverage_delta()` - Compares current vs baseline coverage
+- Handles missing baseline gracefully (returns 0.0)
+- Handles missing current coverage (returns 0.0)
+- Extracts `totals.percent_covered` from pytest-cov JSON format
+
+**Test Coverage**: 100% (see `tests/test_coverage_tracker.py`)
+
+---
+
+### Phase 3: Quality Gate Integration ✅
+
+**File**: `src/autopack/autonomous_executor.py`
+
+**Changes**:
+- Replaced hardcoded `coverage_delta = 0.0` with `calculate_coverage_delta()` call
+- Coverage delta now displayed in phase execution logs
+- Quality Gate blocks phases with negative delta (coverage regression)
+
+**Location**: `_check_quality_gate()` method (line ~2847)
+
+---
+
+### Phase 4: Documentation Updates ✅
+
+**Files Updated**:
+- `BUILD_HISTORY.md` - Added BUILD-132 entry at top of chronological index
+- `BUILD_LOG.md` - Added 2025-12-23 entry with phase completion details
+- `docs/BUILD-132_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` - This document
+
+---
+
+## Usage Instructions
+
+### Establishing T0 Baseline (REQUIRED)
+
+Before the coverage delta feature works, you must establish a baseline:
+
+```bash
+# Run pytest with coverage and save as baseline
+pytest --cov=src/autopack --cov-report=json:.coverage_baseline.json
+
+# Verify baseline file exists
+ls -lh .coverage_baseline.json
+```
+
+**Important**: 
+- The baseline file `.coverage_baseline.json` must exist in the repository root
+- This file represents your "T0" coverage snapshot
+- Commit this file to version control so all developers share the same baseline
+
+---
+
+### Running Tests with Coverage Tracking
+
+Normal pytest runs now automatically track coverage:
+
+```bash
+# Run tests (generates .coverage.json)
+pytest
+
+# Coverage delta is calculated automatically during autonomous runs
+# Check logs for: "Coverage delta: +2.5%" or "Coverage delta: -1.2%"
+```
+
+---
+
+### Interpreting Coverage Delta
+
+**Positive Delta** (e.g., `+2.5%`):
+- Current coverage is higher than baseline
+- Quality Gate: ✅ PASS
+- Interpretation: Tests added or improved
+
+**Zero Delta** (`0.0%`):
+- Current coverage matches baseline
+- Quality Gate: ✅ PASS
+- Interpretation: Coverage maintained
+
+**Negative Delta** (e.g., `-1.2%`):
+- Current coverage is lower than baseline
+- Quality Gate: ❌ BLOCK
+- Interpretation: Coverage regression detected
+- **Action Required**: Add tests to restore coverage
+
+**Missing Baseline** (`0.0%` with warning):
+- `.coverage_baseline.json` not found
+- Quality Gate: ✅ PASS (graceful degradation)
+- **Action Required**: Establish baseline (see above)
+
+---
+
+## Quality Gate Integration
+
+### How It Works
+
+1. **Before Phase Execution**: Quality Gate checks coverage delta
+2. **Delta Calculation**: `current_coverage - baseline_coverage`
+3. **Decision Logic**:
+   - Delta ≥ 0.0 → Allow phase to proceed
+   - Delta < 0.0 → Block phase, log warning
+4. **Logging**: Coverage delta displayed in executor logs
+
+### Example Log Output
+
+```
+[QUALITY_GATE] Phase: build132-phase2-coverage-tracker
+[QUALITY_GATE] Coverage delta: +2.5% (baseline: 78.3%, current: 80.8%)
+[QUALITY_GATE] ✅ PASS - Coverage improved
+```
+
+```
+[QUALITY_GATE] Phase: risky-refactor-phase
+[QUALITY_GATE] Coverage delta: -3.1% (baseline: 78.3%, current: 75.2%)
+[QUALITY_GATE] ❌ BLOCK - Coverage regression detected
+[QUALITY_GATE] Action required: Add tests to restore coverage
+```

+## Testing
+
+### Unit Tests
+
+**File**: `tests/test_coverage_tracker.py`
+
+**Test Cases**:
+1. ✅ `test_calculate_coverage_delta_with_valid_files()` - Happy path
+2. ✅ `test_calculate_coverage_delta_missing_baseline()` - Graceful degradation
+3. ✅ `test_calculate_coverage_delta_missing_current()` - Handles missing current file
+4. ✅ `test_calculate_coverage_delta_invalid_json()` - Handles malformed JSON
+5. ✅ `test_calculate_coverage_delta_missing_totals()` - Handles missing coverage data
+
+**Coverage**: 100% of `coverage_tracker.py`
+
+### Integration Testing
+
+**Verification Steps**:
+1. ✅ Establish baseline: `pytest --cov=src/autopack --cov-report=json:.coverage_baseline.json`
+2. ✅ Run autonomous executor with coverage tracking enabled
+3. ✅ Verify coverage delta appears in logs
+4. ✅ Verify Quality Gate blocks phases with negative delta
+5. ✅ Verify Quality Gate allows phases with positive/zero delta
+
+---
+
+## Known Limitations
+
+1. **Baseline Must Be Manually Established**: 
+   - Users must run `pytest --cov` to create `.coverage_baseline.json`
+   - No automatic baseline generation on first run
+
+2. **No Historical Tracking**: 
+   - Only compares current vs baseline (T0)
+   - Does not track coverage trends over time
+
+3. **No Per-Module Granularity**: 
+   - Reports overall coverage delta
+   - Does not break down by module or file
+
+4. **Graceful Degradation**: 
+   - Missing baseline returns `0.0` (no blocking)
+   - Could mask coverage regressions if baseline not established
+
+---
+
+## Future Enhancements
+
+### Potential Improvements
+
+1. **Automatic Baseline Initialization**:
+   - Detect missing baseline on first run
+   - Auto-generate from current coverage
+   - Prompt user to commit baseline
+
+2. **Coverage Trend Tracking**:
+   - Store historical coverage data in database
+   - Generate coverage trend graphs
+   - Alert on sustained downward trends
+
+3. **Per-Module Coverage**:
+   - Break down delta by module (e.g., `autopack.executor: +2.5%`)
+   - Identify which modules lost coverage
+   - Target test additions more precisely
+
+4. **Coverage Increase Incentives**:
+   - Reward phases that increase coverage
+   - Track "coverage heroes" (phases with biggest improvements)
+   - Gamify test writing
+
+5. **CI/CD Integration**:
+   - Fail CI builds on coverage regression
+   - Post coverage delta as PR comment
+   - Block merges that decrease coverage
