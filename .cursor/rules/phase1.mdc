# Phase 1: Discovery

## CRITICAL: TARGET DIRECTORY CHECK

**THIS RULE MUST BE RUN FROM C:\dev\Autopack** (NOT streamdeck_auto_build!)

Before proceeding, verify your current working directory:
1. Check that you are in `C:\dev\Autopack`
2. If you are in `C:\dev\streamdeck_auto_build` - STOP and ask user to open Cursor from Autopack

**Target Repository**: C:\dev\Autopack
**Purpose**: Scan AUTOPACK codebase for improvements (NOT streamdeck)

---

Using phase_1.md in C:\Users\hshk9\OneDrive\Backup\Desktop, scan for critical/high priority improvements only. Focus on gaps blocking Autopack's self-improvement architecture (telemetry -> memory -> task generation loop).

**NOTE**: This is a NEW project. CREATE fresh files.

**ACTION**: CREATE a new AUTOPACK_IMPS_MASTER.json file at C:\Users\hshk9\OneDrive\Backup\Desktop\AUTOPACK_IMPS_MASTER.json

**COMPLETION MARKER** (REQUIRED):
After discovery is complete, add this field to the root of AUTOPACK_IMPS_MASTER.json:
```json
"phase1_complete": "<today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format>"
```
