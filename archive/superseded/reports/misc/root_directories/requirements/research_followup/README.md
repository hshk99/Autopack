# Research Follow-up Requirements (Tracked)

This directory contains **tracked** follow-up phase requirements that complement the original research chunk requirements under:

- `.autonomous_runs/file-organizer-app-v1/archive/research/active/requirements/` (gitignored workspace artifacts)

These follow-ups implement:
- **Diagnostics parity with Cursor** (handoff bundle + Cursor prompt + optional second opinion triage)
- **Unified research plan gaps** not explicitly covered by the original research chunks (API router exposure, CLI phase management, example docs)

Recommended order:
1. `followup1-diagnostics-handoff-bundle.yaml`
2. `followup2-diagnostics-cursor-prompt.yaml`
3. `followup5-cli-phase-management.yaml`
4. `followup4-research-api-router.yaml`
5. `followup3-diagnostics-second-opinion.yaml` (optional)
6. `followup6-examples-and-docs.yaml`
