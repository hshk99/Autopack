  ## Context: Autopack Autonomous Build System

  I'm using **Autopack**, an autonomous build system that will handle all implementation.

  **What Autopack Does**:
  - Executes 50 phases autonomously (coding, testing, integration)
  - Uses AI (GPT-4o, Claude Opus/Sonnet) for builder and auditor
  - Tracks progress, manages dependencies
  - Handles git operations, CI/CD

  **Your Role**:
  Focus purely on **strategic guidance and analysis**. Don't worry about implementation—Autopack handles that.

      Based on the market research and business analysis, provide RIGOROUS strategic guidance:

      ## PART 1: GO/NO-GO DECISION (MOST CRITICAL)

      1. **Is This Worth Building?**
         - Given TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, is market large enough?
         - Given competitor analysis, can we realistically compete?
         - Given unit economics (CAC/LTV), can this be profitable?
         - **Provide a score (1-10) and clear GO/NO-GO recommendation**

      2. **If NO-GO**:
         - What are the dealbreakers?
         - What would need to change to make it viable?
         - Should we pivot to a different opportunity?

      3. **If GO**:
         - What are the 3-5 strategic imperatives we MUST get right?
         - What's the biggest risk to success?

      ---

      ## PART 2: MARKET STRATEGY (IF GO)

      4. **Customer Segmentation & Prioritization**:
         - Which segment should we target FIRST? (not all at once)
         - Why? (size vs WTP vs CAC vs competitive intensity)
         - What's the sequencing? (Segment 1 → Segment 2 → Segment 3)
         - How to avoid over-narrowing while maintaining focus?

      5. **Competitive Positioning**:
         - What's our 10x advantage? (NOT 10% better)
         - Why would Sparkle users switch? (be brutally honest)
         - Why would ChronoVault users switch? (be brutally honest)
         - What prevents competitors from copying us in 6 months?

      6. **Pricing Strategy**:
         - Free tier: What features? Purpose? (mass market capture)
         - Premium tiers: What's the value ladder?
         - Enterprise: When to pursue?
         - What's realistic conversion rate at each tier?

      ---

      ## PART 3: PRODUCT STRATEGY (IF GO)

      7. **Feature Prioritization**:
         - What's the MINIMUM viable product for Segment 1?
         - What features are table stakes vs differentiators?
         - What can we defer to Phase 2/3 without losing market?
         - How to avoid feature creep?

      8. **Technology Stack** (Profit-Aware):
         - Desktop framework: Electron vs Tauri (cost implications?)
         - OCR: Tesseract vs GPT-4 Vision (cost at scale?)
         - LLM: Local vs Cloud (CAC impact?)
         - What tech choices affect unit economics?
         - Recommendation with COST-BENEFIT analysis

      9. **Build Complexity**:
         - Is 50 phases realistic given this analysis?
         - Should we scope down based on market findings?
         - What's Phase 1 (MVP for Segment 1)?
         - What's Phase 2 (expand to Segment 2)?

      ---

      ## PART 4: FINANCIAL VIABILITY (CRITICAL)

      10. **Revenue Model Validation**:
          - Are our pricing assumptions realistic?
          - What's Year 1/3/5 revenue projection?
          - What's the path to $1M ARR? $10M ARR?
          - Is this fundable if we needed capital?

      11. **Cost Structure Analysis**:
          - Development cost: Realistic for 50-phase build?
          - Infrastructure cost: Cloud costs at scale?
          - Marketing cost: CAC for each segment?
          - What's the burn rate vs runway?

      12. **Unit Economics Deep Dive**:
          - LTV/CAC ratio: Is >3.0 achievable?
          - Payback period: Can we achieve <12 months?
          - Churn rate assumptions: Realistic?
          - What levers improve unit economics most?

      ---

      ## PART 5: RISK & MITIGATION

      13. **Market Risks**:
          - What if TAM is smaller than estimated?
          - What if competitors lower prices?
          - What if we can't achieve target CAC?

      14. **Technical Risks**:
          - What if local LLM performance insufficient?
          - What if OCR accuracy disappoints?
          - What if cross-platform challenges?

      15. **Execution Risks**:
          - What if 50 phases takes 2x longer?
          - What if initial customers churn?
          - What if we can't raise funding (if needed)?

      ---

      ## PART 6: DECISION FRAMEWORKS

      16. **When to Pivot**:
          - What metrics indicate we should pivot?
          - At what point do we kill the project?
          - What's the sunk cost we're willing to accept?

      17. **Success Metrics** (Business-Focused):
          - Month 3: {what_validates_market}
          - Month 6: {what_validates_product}
          - Month 12: {what_validates_business}
          - Year 3: {what_validates_scale}

     - Competitive advantages outlined

  2. **REF_USER_REQUIREMENTS.md**
     - Your requirements compiled
     - Use cases documented
     - Must-have/should-have features listed

  3. **GPT_STRATEGIC_PROMPT.md**
     - Focused prompt for GPT
     - Explains Autopack's role (implementation)
     - Requests strategic guidance only

  ### 🚀 Next Steps

  1. **Review** the reference files (optional but recommended)
  2. **Send to GPT**:
     - Copy `GPT_STRATEGIC_PROMPT.md`
     - Attach `REF_MARKET_RESEARCH.md`
     - Attach `REF_USER_REQUIREMENTS.md`
  3. **GPT will provide**:
     - Technology stack recommendations
     - Architecture design
     - Risk analysis
     - Success criteria
     - Build plan validation
  4. **After GPT responds**:
     - I'll create `BUILD_PLAN_{PROJECT}.md`
     - Start Autopack autonomous build

  **Estimated Time**:
  - GPT analysis: 30-60 minutes
  - Build execution: 3-6 weeks (50 phases)
