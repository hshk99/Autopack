## Triage Guidelines

### High-Confidence (Auto-fixable)
- Dead links to renamed files where the new name is obvious
- Typos in well-known file names
- Links using old directory structure that maps 1:1 to new

### Medium-Confidence (Review Needed)
- Links to files that may have been intentionally removed
- Links to external resources that may have moved
- Cross-references between docs that may need content updates

### Low-Confidence (Manual Review)
- Links where the intent is unclear
- Links to features that may not be implemented yet
- Links embedded in code examples or technical references
