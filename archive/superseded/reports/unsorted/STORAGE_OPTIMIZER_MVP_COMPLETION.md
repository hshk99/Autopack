---

## ✅ What Was Built

### Core Modules Created

All modules are located in `src/autopack/storage_optimizer/`:

1. **[policy.py](../src/autopack/storage_optimizer/policy.py)** - Policy loader and enforcement
   - Loads `config/storage_policy.yaml`
   - Enforces protected paths (NEVER deleted)
   - Checks category matches and retention windows
   - Functions: `load_policy()`, `is_path_protected()`, `get_category_for_path()`

2. **[models.py](../src/autopack/storage_optimizer/models.py)** - Core data structures
   - `ScanResult` - Files/folders found during scan
   - `CleanupCandidate` - Items eligible for cleanup
   - `CleanupPlan` - Collection of candidates
   - `StorageReport` - Complete analysis report

3. **[scanner.py](../src/autopack/storage_optimizer/scanner.py)** - Disk scanning
   - Python-based scanner (os.walk)
   - Scans high-value directories (temp, downloads, dev folders)
   - Calculates directory sizes
   - Returns top space consumers

4. **[classifier.py](../src/autopack/storage_optimizer/classifier.py)** - Policy-aware classification
   - **CRITICAL**: Checks protected paths first (never flags protected items)
   - Matches files against policy categories
   - Respects retention windows
   - Generates human-readable cleanup reasons
   - Provides statistics by category

5. **[reporter.py](../src/autopack/storage_optimizer/reporter.py)** - Report generation
   - Human-readable text reports
   - JSON reports for programmatic access
   - Shows disk usage, top consumers, cleanup opportunities
   - Highlights policy protections
   - Saves to `archive/reports/storage/`

### CLI Tool

**[scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py](../scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py)**
- Command-line interface for scanning and reporting
- Dry-run only (no deletion)
- Multiple scan modes (drive, directory)
- Configurable depth and item limits

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan C: drive (high-value directories only)
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py

# Scan specific drive
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py --drive D

# Scan specific directory
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py --dir c:/dev/Autopack

# Scan with custom depth and limits
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py --max-depth 4 --max-items 5000

# Preview only (don't save report)
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py --no-save
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from autopack.storage_optimizer import (
    load_policy,
    StorageScanner,
    FileClassifier,
    StorageReporter
)

# Load policy
policy = load_policy()

# Scan directories
scanner = StorageScanner(max_depth=3)
results = scanner.scan_high_value_directories("C")

# Classify candidates
classifier = FileClassifier(policy)
candidates = classifier.classify_batch(results)

# Get statistics
stats = classifier.get_statistics(candidates)
print(f"Found {stats['total_candidates']} cleanup candidates")
print(f"Potential savings: {stats['total_size_bytes'] / (1024**3):.2f} GB")

# Generate report
reporter = StorageReporter()
# ... create and print report
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Policy Integration ✅

- **Protected paths enforced**: SOT files, src/, tests/, .git/, databases, archive/superseded/
- **Category-based classification**: dev_caches, diagnostics_logs, runs, archive_buckets
- **Retention windows respected**: Won't flag items within retention periods
- **Approval requirements**: Marks which items need manual approval

### Safety First ✅

- **Dry-run only**: MVP does NOT delete anything
- **Protected path checking**: First check in classification pipeline
- **Clear reporting**: Shows what's protected and why
- **Conservative defaults**: When in doubt, require approval

### Performance ✅

- **Focused scanning**: Targets high-value directories instead of full disk scan
- **Configurable limits**: Prevent memory issues with large directories
- **Depth control**: Limits how deep into directory trees to scan
- **Efficient size calculation**: Depth-limited for large directories

---

## 📊 Test Results

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Quick Scan

```bash
# See what could be cleaned up on C: drive
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py
```

Expected output:
- Disk usage summary
- Protected paths (databases, SOT files)
- Top space consumers
- Cleanup opportunities by category
- Potential savings estimate

### Example 2: Specific Directory Analysis

```bash
# Analyze a development project
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py --dir c:/dev/my-project --max-depth 4
```

Use case: Find old node_modules, venv, build artifacts in a specific project.

### Example 3: Deep Scan with Limits

```bash
# Deep scan but limit items to prevent memory issues
python scripts/storage/scan_and_report.py --max-depth 5 --max-items 20000
```

Use case: Thorough analysis of large directory trees.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Scanning speed**: Python os.walk is slow compared to WizTree
   - Mitigation: Focuses on high-value directories only
   - Future: WizTree integration will address this

2. **No actual cleanup**: MVP is reporting-only
   - Mitigation: This is intentional for safety
   - Future: Phase 2 will add execution

3. **Limited category detection**: Only 5 categories currently
   - Mitigation: Policy can be easily extended
   - Future: Add more categories as patterns emerge

4. **Windows-only paths**: Scanner targets Windows-specific directories
   - Mitigation: Works on Windows (primary target platform)
   - Future: Add cross-platform support if needed

## ✨ Highlights

### What Makes This MVP Valuable

1. **Policy-First Design**: All decisions driven by policy, not hardcoded
2. **Safety Guarantees**: Protected paths can never be deleted
3. **Immediate Value**: See cleanup opportunities without risk
4. **Easy to Extend**: Clear path to add execution, automation, optimization
5. **Well-Documented**: Code, policy, and usage all documented
6. **Tested**: Verified on real Autopack repository

### Integration with Autopack Ecosystem

- Uses `config/storage_policy.yaml` (same as Tidy will use)
- Saves reports to `archive/reports/storage/` (standard Autopack location)
- Respects SOT protection rules
- Coordinates with Tidy (policy specifies ordering)
- Ready for autonomous executor integration (future phase)

---

## 📞 Support

### If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Import errors**: Ensure `PYTHONPATH=src` is set
2. **Policy not found**: Run from Autopack repository root
3. **Permission errors**: Some directories may be inaccessible (this is normal, they're skipped)
4. **Slow scanning**: Use `--max-depth` and `--max-items` to limit scope

### Future Enhancements

See "Next Steps" section above for planned improvements.

### Optional LLM-Powered Features (Phase 2+)

The MVP uses **zero tokens** (deterministic pattern matching only). Future phases can optionally add LLM-powered features:

**Smart Categorization** (optional upgrade):
- Use LLM to classify ambiguous files that don't match glob patterns
- Estimated: ~2K tokens per 100 ambiguous files (~$0.006 per scan with GLM-4.7)
- Example: Classify unusual build artifacts, vendor directories, temporary data

**Approval Justifications** (optional):
- Generate natural language explanations for risky deletions requiring approval
- Estimated: ~5K tokens per 50 risky items (~$0.015 per approval batch with GLM-4.7)
- Example: "This 10GB cache directory hasn't been accessed in 6 months and can be regenerated by running 'npm install', saving disk space with minimal risk"

**Cleanup Strategy Recommendations** (optional):
- LLM suggests optimal cleanup order based on scan results, disk pressure, and usage patterns
- Estimated: ~10K tokens per strategic analysis (~$0.03 per recommendation with GLM-4.7)
- Example: "Prioritize deleting old node_modules (20GB, easily regenerated) before compressing diagnostic logs (5GB, may need for debugging)"

**When to Enable**: Only enable LLM features if:
1. You have many ambiguous files (>100) that don't match policy patterns
2. You want human-readable justifications for deletion approvals (audit trail)
3. You need strategic guidance on cleanup priorities (complex environments)

**Cost vs. Value**: For typical usage, the deterministic MVP is sufficient. LLM features add ~$0.05-0.10 per scan but provide better explainability and handling of edge cases.
