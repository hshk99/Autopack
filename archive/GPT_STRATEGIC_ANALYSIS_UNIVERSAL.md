## YOUR DELIVERABLES

Provide a **single, focused response** structured as follows:

---

## PART 1: GO/NO-GO DECISION (MOST CRITICAL)

### 1.1 Overall Score & Decision

**Score**: `{score}/10` (Average of 4 dimensions: Market, Competitive, Financial, Technical)

**Decision**: **`{GO | CONDITIONAL GO | NO-GO}`**

**Confidence Level**: `{HIGH | MODERATE | LOW}`

---

### 1.2 Dimension Scores (Validate or Challenge)

Validate or adjust the scores from the research document:

| Dimension | Research Score | Your Score | Adjustment Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Market Opportunity** | `{research_score_1}`/10 | **`{your_score_1}`**/10 | `{why_same_or_different}` |

| **Technical Feasibility** | `{research_score_4}`/10 | **`{your_score_4}`**/10 | `{why_same_or_different}` |

**Overall Score Adjustment**: `{agree | disagree}` with research overall score of `{research_overall}` because `{rationale}`

---

### 1.3 Critical Strengths (Why GO)

What makes this product viable?

1. **`{strength_1}`** (e.g., "Large, growing market: $13.7B TAM, 17.9% CAGR, clear pain points")
2. **`{strength_2}`** (e.g., "Strong unit economics: LTV/CAC = 6.4, payback 5 months, profitable at scale")
3. **`{strength_3}`** (e.g., "Moderate switching likelihood: 40-50% from Sparkle, 30-40% from legal tools")

---

### 1.4 Critical Weaknesses (Why CAUTION or NO-GO)

What are the dealbreakers or red flags?

1. **`{weakness_1}`** (e.g., "Weak competitive moat: 12-24 month lead, easily replicable by incumbents")
2. **`{weakness_2}`** (e.g., "Differentiation unclear: Is cross-platform + legal truly 10x better, or just 2-3x?")
3. **`{weakness_3}`** (e.g., "High capital requirement: $400K-$600K with 18-24 month payback")

---

### 1.5 If CONDITIONAL GO: What Conditions MUST Be Met?

List **specific, measurable conditions** that de-risk the project:

1. **`{condition_1}`** (e.g., "Validate 10x differentiation in Month 3 alpha: 90%+ categorization accuracy confirmed vs Sparkle 60-70%")
2. **`{condition_2}`** (e.g., "Monitor General user conversion at Month 6: If <5%, pivot to Legal-only (higher ARPU segment)")
3. **`{condition_3}`** (e.g., "Secure $400K capital with 18-24 month runway to break-even, or scope down MVP to $200K bootstrap")

---

### 1.6 If NO-GO: What Are the Dealbreakers?

If you recommend NO-GO, what are the fatal flaws?

1. **`{dealbreaker_1}`** (e.g., "Switching barrier too high: 80% of users have HIGH switching cost, only 20% likely to switch")
2. **`{dealbreaker_2}`** (e.g., "No true 10x differentiation: Honest analysis shows only 2x better, not defensible")
3. **`{dealbreaker_3}`** (e.g., "Weak unit economics: LTV/CAC = 0.8, unprofitable even at scale")

**What Would Make It Viable**: `{changes_needed}` (e.g., "If incumbents raised prices 3-5x OR if we achieved proprietary 10x AI advantage")

---

## PART 2: STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES (IF GO)

### 2.1 Top 3 Strategic Imperatives (MUST Get Right)

Validate or revise the research document's imperatives:

#### **Imperative 1**: `{imperative_1_title}`

**What**: `{imperative_1_description}` (e.g., "Nail 10x differentiation: Achieve 90%+ categorization accuracy vs competitors' 60-70%")

**Why Critical**: `{imperative_1_rationale}` (e.g., "This is the ONLY defensible moat. Without 10x accuracy, it's just 'a bit better' and won't overcome switching inertia.")

**How to Measure Success**: `{imperative_1_metric}` (e.g., "Month 3 alpha: 50 testers, A/B test vs Sparkle, measure accuracy delta. Target: >25% improvement.")

**Risk if Failed**: `{imperative_1_risk}` (e.g., "If <90% accuracy, differentiation is weak (2-3x not 10x) → users won't switch → NO-GO")

---

#### **Imperative 2**: `{imperative_2_title}`

[Repeat structure]

---

#### **Imperative 3**: `{imperative_3_title}`

[Repeat structure]

---

### 2.2 Validate or Revise Strategic Imperatives

**Do you agree with the research imperatives?**: `{agree | disagree}`

**If DISAGREE, what should the top 3 be instead?**:
1. `{revised_imperative_1}`
2. `{revised_imperative_2}`
3. `{revised_imperative_3}`

**Rationale for Changes**: `{rationale}`

---

## PART 3: MARKET STRATEGY (IF GO)

### 3.1 Customer Segment Prioritization

Validate or challenge the research segment priority:

**Research Recommendation**: Target `{research_priority_segment}` first because `{research_rationale}`

**Your Assessment**:
- **Agree / Disagree**: `{agree | disagree}`
- **Your Recommended Priority**:
  1. **Primary Segment (Phase 1)**: `{your_segment_1}` because `{your_rationale_1}`
  2. **Secondary Segment (Phase 2)**: `{your_segment_2}` because `{your_rationale_2}`
  3. **Tertiary Segment (Phase 3+)**: `{your_segment_3}` because `{your_rationale_3}`

**Critical Insight**: Should focus be `{single_segment | multi_segment_hybrid}` because `{insight}`

**Example**: "Disagree. Research prioritizes General users (200M, LTV/CAC 3.0) but I recommend Legal professionals (5M, LTV/CAC 6.0) first because:
- Higher LTV/CAC justifies higher CAC ($200-$400 vs $30-$50)
- Clearer 10x differentiation (legal timeline cockpit vs generic file organization)
- Lower competitive intensity (fewer competitors in affordable legal tools)
Then expand to General users once brand established."

---

### 3.2 Competitive Positioning (10x Advantage Validation)

**Research Claim**: `{research_differentiation_statement}` (e.g., "First AI file organizer that understands document CONTENT, not filenames, with 90%+ accuracy + scenario packs at 1/5th enterprise prices")

**Your Honest Assessment**: Is this TRULY 10x better, or 2-3x?

**10x Validation**:
- **Baseline (Competitor)**: `{baseline_metric}` (e.g., "Sparkle: 60-70% accuracy, Mac-only, $20 one-time, no ongoing value")
- **Our Product**: `{our_metric}` (e.g., "Us: 90%+ accuracy, cross-platform, $10/mo with ongoing maintenance + scenario packs")
- **Quantified Delta**: `{delta_calculation}` (e.g., "1.5x accuracy × 3 platforms × 12 months value × unique packs = 5-7x better, NOT 10x")

**Verdict**: `{10x_confirmed | 3-5x_realistic | 2x_weak}`

**If NOT 10x, what would make it 10x?**:
- `{suggestion_1}` (e.g., "Achieve 95%+ accuracy (vs 60-70%) = 1.5x current delta")
- `{suggestion_2}` (e.g., "Add AI-powered 'smart cleanup' that saves users 80% of time vs manual")
- `{suggestion_3}` (e.g., "Build network effects: User-generated rules/packs shared via marketplace")

---

### 3.3 Refined Positioning Statement (Outcome-Focused)

Revise the positioning to focus on **customer outcomes**, not features:

**Research Positioning**: `{research_positioning}`

**Your Refined Positioning**:
> `{refined_positioning}` (e.g., "FileOrganizer saves solo legal practitioners 50-80% on accountant/paralegal fees by turning messy case files into court-ready timelines in 1/10th the time of manual work — all offline and affordable.")

**Why This Framing**: `{positioning_rationale}` (e.g., "Focuses on outcome (save money + time) not features (OCR + LLM). Quantifies value (50-80% savings). Addresses pain (expensive paralegals). Emphasizes USP (offline, affordable).")

---

### 3.4 Switching Cost Analysis (Realistic Assessment)

**Research Switching Likelihood**:
- From Sparkle: `{sparkle_likelihood}%`
- From ChronoVault: `{chronovault_likelihood}%`

**Your Assessment**: Are these realistic or optimistic?

**Adjusted Switching Likelihood** (if needed):
- From Sparkle: **`{your_sparkle_likelihood}%`** because `{rationale}`
- From ChronoVault: **`{your_chronovault_likelihood}%`** because `{rationale}`

**Critical Insight**: `{insight}` (e.g., "Research assumes 40-50% from Sparkle but this is OPTIMISTIC. Realistic is 25-35% because most Mac users are 'satisfied enough' with Sparkle and switching inertia is higher than estimated. Should target Windows users first (no Sparkle, zero switching barrier).")

---

## PART 4: PRODUCT STRATEGY (IF GO)

### 4.1 Pricing & Packaging Validation

**Research Proposed Tiers**:
- Free: `{research_free_features}`
- Pro: $`{research_pro_price}`/mo with `{research_pro_features}`
- Business: $`{research_business_price}`/mo with `{research_business_features}`
- Enterprise: Custom

**Your Assessment**:
- **Free Tier**: `{too_generous | appropriate | too_restrictive}` because `{rationale}`
- **Pro Tier Pricing**: `{too_cheap | appropriate | too_expensive}` because `{rationale}`
- **Business Tier Pricing**: `{competitive | uncompetitive}` vs competitors' `{competitor_price}` because `{rationale}`

**Recommended Adjustments**:
- Free tier limits: `{adjusted_limits}` (e.g., "Reduce from 1,000 files/mo to 500 to increase conversion urgency")
- Pro tier price: `{adjusted_pro_price}` (e.g., "Raise from $9.99 to $12.99 to match WTP data")
- Business tier features: `{adjusted_business_features}` (e.g., "Move timeline feature from Business to Pro+ at $19.99 to capture mid-market")

**Conversion Rate Validation**:
- Research assumes Free→Pro: `{research_conversion}%`, Your estimate: **`{your_conversion}%`** because `{rationale}`
- Research assumes Pro→Business: `{research_business_conversion}%`, Your estimate: **`{your_business_conversion}%`** because `{rationale}`

---

### 4.2 MVP Scope (Narrow Focus for 6-9 Months)

**Research Proposed MVP**: `{research_MVP_phases}` phases over `{research_MVP_months}` months

**Your Assessment**: Is this achievable?

**Recommended MVP Scope**:
- **Must-Have (Phase 1, Months 1-6)**:
  1. `{must_have_1}` (e.g., "Core file scanner + OCR (Tesseract local)")
  2. `{must_have_2}` (e.g., "LLM categorization (Qwen2-7B local)")
  3. `{must_have_3}` (e.g., "Staging area with Before→After preview")
  4. `{must_have_4}` (e.g., "Generic pack template (user-defined categories)")
  5. `{must_have_5}` (e.g., "Rollback operations log")

- **Should-Have (Phase 2, Months 7-12)**:
  - `{should_have_1}` (e.g., "Country-specific tax pack (AU BAS)")
  - `{should_have_2}` (e.g., "Cloud OCR/LLM fallback for Pro tier")
  - `{should_have_3}` (e.g., "Semantic search UI")

- **Nice-to-Have (Phase 3+, Defer)**:
  - `{nice_to_have_1}` (e.g., "Voice input for commands")
  - `{nice_to_have_2}` (e.g., "Team features, API access")

**Scope Adjustment Rationale**: `{rationale}` (e.g., "Research proposes 40 phases in 6-9 months (5-7 phases/month) which is AGGRESSIVE. Recommend 25-30 phases for MVP to reduce execution risk. Defer country-specific packs to Phase 2 after validating generic templates.")

---

### 4.3 Phased Roadmap (Months 1-24)

**Phase 1: MVP (Months 1-9)**
- **Goal**: `{phase_1_goal}` (e.g., "Ship usable product with generic file organization + basic packs, acquire 1K users, 50 paying")
- **Deliverable**: `{phase_1_deliverable}` (e.g., "Desktop app (Windows/Mac), local OCR+LLM, staging area, rollback, generic tax/immigration/legal packs")
- **Success Metric**: `{phase_1_metric}` (e.g., "1,000 users, 50 paying ($5K MRR), 80%+ usability score, 5% conversion")

**Phase 2: Market Validation & Iteration (Months 10-18)**
- **Goal**: `{phase_2_goal}` (e.g., "Validate segment prioritization, add country-specific packs, improve accuracy based on user feedback")
- **Deliverable**: `{phase_2_deliverable}` (e.g., "AU BAS pack, UK Self Assessment pack, cloud OCR/LLM fallback, semantic search")
- **Success Metric**: `{phase_2_metric}` (e.g., "5,000 users, 250 paying ($25K MRR), <20% churn, break-even approaching")
- **Decision Point**: `{phase_2_decision}` (e.g., "Month 12: If General conversion <5%, pivot to Legal-only")

**Phase 3: Scale & Profitability (Months 19-24)**
- **Goal**: `{phase_3_goal}` (e.g., "Scale to 10K users, achieve profitability, add Enterprise tier")
- **Deliverable**: `{phase_3_deliverable}` (e.g., "Team features, API access, Linux support, Enterprise tier launch")
- **Success Metric**: `{phase_3_metric}` (e.g., "10K users, 800 paying ($80K MRR), profitable, LTV/CAC >3.0 validated")

---

## PART 5: TECHNICAL STRATEGY (IF GO)

### 5.1 Architecture Sanity Check

**Research Proposed Tech Stack**:
- Desktop: `{research_desktop_framework}` (e.g., Tauri 2.0)
- OCR: `{research_OCR_strategy}` (e.g., Hybrid: Tesseract local + GPT-4 Vision cloud fallback)
- LLM: `{research_LLM}` (e.g., Qwen2-7B local, GPT-4o cloud fallback)
- Database: `{research_database}` (e.g., SQLite)

**Your Assessment**: Are these choices sound?

**Validation or Alternative Recommendations**:

| Component | Research Choice | Your Assessment | Alternative (if needed) | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Desktop Framework** | `{research_desktop}` | `{sound | risky}` | `{alternative}` | `{rationale}` |
| **OCR Strategy** | `{research_OCR}` | `{sound | risky}` | `{alternative}` | `{rationale}` |
| **LLM** | `{research_LLM}` | `{sound | risky}` | `{alternative}` | `{rationale}` |
| **Database** | `{research_DB}` | `{sound | risky}` | `{alternative}` | `{rationale}` |

**Example**: "Tauri 2.0 is RISKY due to WebView inconsistencies on Linux/Windows. Consider Electron for Phase 1 (proven, consistent UI) despite larger binary size. Trade-off: 50MB binary vs cross-platform bugs. Switch to Tauri Phase 2 if demand for lightweight app."

---

### 5.2 Profit-Sensitive Tech Choices

**Cost Implications of Tech Stack**:

| Technology | Cost Model | Impact on Unit Economics | Risk |
|------------|------------|--------------------------|------|
| **Cloud OCR (GPT-4 Vision)** | `{cost_per_page}` per page | At 20% usage, 200 pages/user = $`{cost_per_user}`/mo → Eats `{percentage}%` of Pro tier ARPU | `{risk_level}` |
| **Cloud LLM (GPT-4o)** | `{cost_per_token}` per 1M tokens | At 10% usage, 500K tokens/user = $`{cost_per_user}`/mo → Eats `{percentage}%` of Pro tier ARPU | `{risk_level}` |
| **Hosting (AWS/GCP)** | $`{cost}` per 1,000 users | Fixed cost, scales linearly | LOW |

**Critical Question**: Do cloud API costs exceed `{threshold}%` of ARPU? (e.g., >30% is unsustainable)

**Mitigation if Costs Too High**:
- `{mitigation_1}` (e.g., "Limit cloud OCR to 100 pages/mo on Pro tier, charge $0.02/page overage")
- `{mitigation_2}` (e.g., "Offer local-only mode at $5/mo (lower price, no cloud costs)")

---

## PART 6: FINANCIAL STRATEGY (IF GO)

### 6.1 Unit Economics Deep Dive

**Research Unit Economics**:
- CAC: $`{research_CAC}`
- LTV: $`{research_LTV}`
- LTV/CAC: `{research_LTV_CAC}`
- Payback: `{research_payback}` months

**Your Assessment**: Are these achievable?

**Sensitivity Analysis** (Pessimistic Scenarios):

| Scenario | CAC | LTV | LTV/CAC | Payback | Profitable? |
|----------|-----|-----|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Base Case** | $`{base_CAC}` | $`{base_LTV}` | `{base_ratio}` | `{base_payback}` mo | `{yes | no}` |
| **Higher Churn** (12 mo retention vs 20 mo) | $`{CAC}` | $`{LTV_churn}` | `{ratio_churn}` | `{payback_churn}` mo | `{yes | no}` |
| **Higher CAC** (+$50) | $`{CAC_high}` | $`{LTV}` | `{ratio_CAC_high}` | `{payback_CAC_high}` mo | `{yes | no}` |
| **Lower ARPU** (-$3/mo) | $`{CAC}` | $`{LTV_ARPU_low}` | `{ratio_ARPU_low}` | `{payback_ARPU_low}` mo | `{yes | no}` |

**Critical Insight**: `{insight}` (e.g., "LTV/CAC is FRAGILE: If churn increases from 20 months to 12 months retention, LTV/CAC drops from 6.4 to 3.8. Must focus on retention (product stickiness, quarterly reminders, ongoing value) to maintain healthy unit economics.")

---

### 6.2 Revenue Projections Validation

**Research Projections**:
- Year 1: $`{Y1_revenue}`, `{Y1_users}` users, `{Y1_conversion}%` conversion
- Year 3: $`{Y3_revenue}`, `{Y3_users}` users, `{Y3_conversion}%` conversion
- Year 5: $`{Y5_revenue}`, `{Y5_users}` users, `{Y5_conversion}%` conversion

**Your Assessment**: `{realistic | optimistic | pessimistic}`

**Adjusted Projections** (if needed):

| Year | Research Revenue | Your Revenue | Adjustment Rationale |
|------|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1    | $`{Y1_research}` | $`{Y1_your}` | `{rationale}` |
| 3    | $`{Y3_research}` | $`{Y3_your}` | `{rationale}` |
| 5    | $`{Y5_research}` | $`{Y5_your}` | `{rationale}` |

**Most Fragile Assumption**: `{assumption}` (e.g., "Conversion rate growing from 5% (Y1) to 10% (Y5) is OPTIMISTIC. Industry benchmark is 2-5% for freemium SaaS. If conversion stays at 5%, Year 5 revenue drops from $12M to $6M.")

---

### 6.3 Capital Requirements & Funding Strategy

**Research Capital Requirement**: $`{research_capital}` for `{months}` months to break-even

**Your Assessment**: `{sufficient | underestimated | overestimated}`

**Adjusted Capital Requirement**:
- **Development**: $`{dev_capital}` (research: $`{research_dev}`, your adjustment: `{dev_adjustment}`)
- **Marketing**: $`{marketing_capital}` (research: $`{research_marketing}`, your adjustment: `{marketing_adjustment}`)
- **Infrastructure**: $`{infra_capital}`
- **Runway Buffer** (20%): $`{buffer}`
- **Total**: **$`{total_capital}`**

**Funding Recommendation**: `{bootstrap | seed_round | series_A}`

**If Bootstrap** (self-funded):
- Scope down MVP to $`{bootstrap_amount}` (defer `{deferred_features}`)
- Accept slower growth (`{slower_growth_rate}%`/month vs `{fast_growth_rate}%`)
- Target profitability Month `{bootstrap_breakeven}` (vs Month `{funded_breakeven}`)

**If Seed Round** ($`{seed_amount}`):
- Target milestones: `{milestone_1}`, `{milestone_2}`, `{milestone_3}`
- Use of funds: `{use_1}`, `{use_2}`, `{use_3}`
- Series A readiness: `{series_A_metrics}` (e.g., "$1M ARR, 10K users, <20% churn")

---

## PART 7: RISK MITIGATION (IF GO)

### 7.1 Top 10 Risks (Validate or Revise)

Validate the research risk matrix and provide mitigations:

| # | Risk | Research L×I | Your L×I | Mitigation | Contingency |
|---|------|--------------|----------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | `{risk_1}` | `{research_priority_1}` | **`{your_priority_1}`** | `{mitigation_1}` | `{contingency_1}` |
| 2 | `{risk_2}` | `{research_priority_2}` | **`{your_priority_2}`** | `{mitigation_2}` | `{contingency_2}` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 10 | `{risk_10}` | `{research_priority_10}` | **`{your_priority_10}`** | `{mitigation_10}` | `{contingency_10}` |

**Example**:
- **Risk 1**: Sparkle adds cross-platform (Research: 7×8=56, Your: 8×9=**72** because Sparkle has resources and incentive to expand)
  - **Mitigation**: Execute fast (12-month MVP vs 18-month), build data moat (user corrections → better models), focus on scenario packs Sparkle won't have
  - **Contingency**: If Sparkle announces cross-platform in Month 6, pivot positioning to "Sparkle for cleanup, FileOrganizer for life admin packs (tax/immigration/legal)"

---

### 7.2 Pivot Triggers (Explicit Metrics)

Validate or refine the research pivot triggers:

**Research Pivot Triggers**:
1. `{research_pivot_1}` (e.g., "Month 6: If General user conversion <5%, pivot to Legal-only")
2. `{research_pivot_2}` (e.g., "Month 12: If local LLM accuracy <70%, pivot to cloud-first")

**Your Refined Pivot Triggers**:

| Trigger # | Metric | Threshold | Action | Timeline |
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `{metric_1}` | `{threshold_1}` | `{action_1}` | `{when_1}` |
| 2 | `{metric_2}` | `{threshold_2}` | `{action_2}` | `{when_2}` |
| 3 | `{metric_3}` | `{threshold_3}` | `{action_3}` | `{when_3}` |

**Example**:
- **Trigger 1**: Conversion rate < 3% at Month 6 (not 5% – be more conservative) → Pivot to Legal-only, raise Business tier to $99/mo, discontinue free tier
- **Trigger 2**: Churn > 30% at Month 12 → Product-market fit issue, conduct user interviews, major feature pivot or shut down
- **Trigger 3**: <2,000 paying users at Month 18 (vs 5,000 break-even target) → Shut down or raise emergency bridge funding

---

### 7.3 Kill Criteria (When to Shut Down)

Define **explicit shutdown triggers** to avoid sunk cost fallacy:

**Kill Criteria** (If ANY are true, recommend shutdown):
1. `{kill_1}` (e.g., "Month 18: <2,000 paying users (vs 5,000 needed for break-even) AND no funding available")
2. `{kill_2}` (e.g., "Month 12: Churn >40% for 3 consecutive months (indicates fundamental product-market fit failure)")
3. `{kill_3}` (e.g., "Month 6: Unable to achieve 10x differentiation (accuracy <80% vs competitors' 60-70% = only 1.3x better)")

**Sunk Cost Tolerance**: `{max_sunk_cost}` (e.g., "$200K capital, 12 months time")

**Graceful Shutdown Plan**:
- Offer refunds to paying users
- Open-source codebase (good for brand/reputation)
- Write post-mortem (share learnings publicly)

---

## PART 8: FOUNDER BRIEF (FINAL SUMMARY)

### 8.1 One-Paragraph Summary

Compress everything into **actionable founder guidance**:

> `{one_paragraph_summary}` (Example: "GO with CAUTION (Score: 6.6/10). Large market ($13.7B) + strong unit economics (LTV/CAC 6.4) + moderate switching likelihood (40-50%) justify building, BUT weak moat (12-24 month lead) + unclear 10x differentiation (2-3x realistic) require fast execution. Top 3 imperatives: (1) Nail 10x accuracy (90%+ vs 60-70%), (2) Validate segment prioritization by Month 6 (General vs Legal), (3) Execute fast (ship MVP in 6-9 months). If General conversion <5% at Month 6, pivot to Legal-only. Capital requirement: $400K for 18-24 month runway. Break-even: 5K-8K paying users. Biggest risk: Sparkle adds cross-platform before we establish moat.")

---

### 8.2 Next 30 Days (Immediate Actions)

What should the founder do in the next 30 days?

1. **`{action_1}`** (e.g., "Validate 10x differentiation assumption: Recruit 20 Sparkle users, run A/B test of categorization accuracy. Target: >25% improvement (90%+ vs 60-70%).")
2. **`{action_2}`** (e.g., "Secure $400K capital: Decide bootstrap ($200K scope-down) vs seed round ($400K full build). If seed, prepare investor deck with this analysis.")
3. **`{action_3}`** (e.g., "Define pack configuration schema: Create YAML/JSON template for tax/immigration/legal packs based on Cursor research report.")
4. **`{action_4}`** (e.g., "Recruit 50 beta users from Windows users (zero Sparkle competition) via ProductHunt, Reddit r/productivity, HN.")

---

### 8.3 Decision Checklist (Before Starting Build)

| Question | Answer | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Is 10x differentiation validated (not just assumed)? | `{yes | no | tbd}` | `{✅ | ⚠️ | ❌}` |
| Is segment prioritization clear (General vs Legal vs hybrid)? | `{yes | no | tbd}` | `{✅ | ⚠️ | ❌}` |
| Is capital secured ($400K+ or bootstrap $200K)? | `{yes | no | tbd}` | `{✅ | ⚠️ | ❌}` |
| Are pivot triggers defined (Month 6 decision point)? | `{yes | no | tbd}` | `{✅ | ⚠️ | ❌}` |
| Is MVP scope realistic (6-9 months, 25-30 phases)? | `{yes | no | tbd}` | `{✅ | ⚠️ | ❌}` |

**Recommendation**: `{proceed | defer | pivot}` because `{rationale}`

## HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE (FOR GPT)

1. **Read the attached rigorous market research document** thoroughly
2. **Validate ALL claims** with your own knowledge (challenge assumptions, not just agree)
3. **Provide honest assessment** (especially on 10x differentiation – don't sugarcoat)
4. **Be specific with numbers** (not "should be higher" but "$12.99 instead of $9.99 because WTP data shows...")
5. **Focus on actionable guidance** (what should founder do in next 30 days, not abstract strategy)
6. **Challenge segment prioritization** (largest market ≠ best market, LTV/CAC matters more)
7. **Sanity-check unit economics** (run sensitivity analysis, identify fragile assumptions)
8. **Define explicit pivot/kill triggers** (prevent sunk cost fallacy)

**Your role is truth-serum, not cheerleader. Be brutally honest to prevent wasted effort on unviable products.**
