# Multi-Project Orchestration Configuration
#
# Controls batch processing and parallel execution of multiple projects.
# Used by MultiProjectOrchestrator for resource management and execution strategy.

# Resource Limits
# ===============

# Maximum number of projects to execute in parallel
# Limits concurrent project execution to prevent resource exhaustion
max_parallel_projects: 4

# Maximum API calls allowed per minute across all projects
# Prevents rate limiting and quota exhaustion
max_api_calls_per_minute: 100

# Maximum concurrent memory usage in MB
# Limits total memory footprint across all active projects
max_concurrent_memory_mb: 2000

# Maximum disk I/O throughput in MB/s
# Prevents disk saturation and ensures system responsiveness
max_disk_io_mbps: 50.0

# Maximum wall-clock time per project in hours
# Stops projects that exceed this timeout
per_project_timeout_hours: 2

# Maximum wall-clock time per phase in minutes
# Stops individual phases that exceed this timeout
phase_timeout_minutes: 30


# Execution Strategy
# ==================

# Execution strategy for processing projects
# Options: parallel, sequential, staged, adaptive
# - parallel: All projects simultaneously (default)
# - sequential: One at a time (fallback mode)
# - staged: All research, then all builds, then deployments, etc.
# - adaptive: Monitor resources and adjust parallelism dynamically
execution_strategy: parallel

# Enable adaptive strategy adjustments
# Allows orchestrator to reduce parallelism if resources constrained
enable_adaptive_strategy: true


# Resource Tracking
# =================

# Enable real-time resource monitoring
# Tracks CPU, memory, disk I/O, and API usage
enable_resource_tracking: true

# Interval for resource checks in seconds
resource_check_interval_seconds: 5.0


# Error Handling
# ==============

# Stop all projects if one fails
# If false, failed projects are isolated and don't affect others
fail_fast: false

# Isolate project errors from batch execution
# If true, project failures don't fail the entire batch
error_isolation: true


# Monitoring & Progress
# =====================

# Enable progress tracking for all projects
# Logs real-time progress and metrics
enable_progress_tracking: true

# Interval for progress reports in seconds
progress_report_interval_seconds: 10.0
